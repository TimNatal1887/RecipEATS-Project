Who's ready to indulge in their favorite recipes? Our "Heaven Seven" team -- Haiyah, Tim, Marlon & Lenny -- have accepted the challenge. We created an application using ReactJS to enable any picky eater to filter out those ingredients that just doesn't fit into their diet, but still enjoy a variety of the most fabulous handpicked recipes, over and over again! Hence our name, `*recipEATS!*` Our landing page invites you to bite in, then explore the various recipes we offer. However, to gain our trust, use our special search bar that eliminates the ingredients you have to avoid, yet allows you to zero-in on that dish's recipe, worry-free. The four of us worked closely together, practicing and using the below **Project Tools & Skills**:
- React Hooks
- React Router 6.2.1
- Forms
- Controlled Inputs
- Event Handlers
- Fetch API
- Promises
- Data Manipulation & Parsing
- Helper Functions
- HTML, CSS, JS
- CSS Grid (optional) 
- Flexbox (optional)
- Render.com backend deployment
- Netlify.com frontend deployment
- Self learning
- ChatGPT
- AI

# Features
-Our `landing page` is a winner. It's simple, but the complex, carousel of visuals almost make it edible. One bite, and you're hooked into our world of recipes. It also has an `About Us` link, connecting the user to us -- the team that built this app.

-Functionality immediately by clicking the imagery, navigating to recipes.

-A unique `search bar` that defines the phrase 'dietary bliss by omission'.

-Besides the incredible recipes, the `reviews` section allows the user to best steer the next avid recipe-r towards recipes aligned with their cravings.

## Installation
To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1st..

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/TimNatal1887/RecipEATS-Project.git

2nd...

Navigate to the project directory:

cd `project-startup-challenge`

3rd...

Install dependencies: npm i

Start the development server: npm start

### Components
`About` Component
The `About component` simply links the go-to information for the **About Us** page that informs any user on the make-up and contact info about our group, Heaven Seven -- 4 creators of the **recipEATS!** site/app.

`Landing` Component
For the `Landing component`, this is your first stop on our page as a user. From this Landing page, there's a 'carousel' medley of images, each one if clicked on, takes you to the more detailed list of Recipes page, displaying our various recipes and dishes.

`Carousel` Component
The `Carousel component` is to grab the user's attention with the imagery of 3 different recipe dishes, making the app more appealing and engaging.

`Recipe` Component
The `Recipe component` is to display the details for individual recipes, for the user to add feedback and reviews, including 1-5 star ratings, country of origin, whether it's vegan, vegetarian or gluten-free, and is a huge part of the app, which for us, must have an inclusion of community.

`Recipes` Component
The `Recipes component` -- not to mixed up with the above 'Recipe' component, displays every recipe available, broken down by dish image, dish name and of course the recipe's list of ingredients.

`Header` Component
The `Header component` is up top, as its name suggests, on the landing page. It's the simplest component, carrying our *recipEATS!* title/link and our 'About Us' link.

`ReviewsForm` Component
The `ReviewsForm` holds a separate file for each fetch. For the two functions, one fetch grabs all the recipe data, and another fetch grabs one recipe based on the ID.

`RecipeDetails` Component
Our `RecipeDetails component` works hand-in-hand with the `Recipes` component to give the user a taste of some very entertaining details about the recipe. From their 'country of origin' to 'Spice Level', and from 'Meal Prep' time to  giving the user the option to even 'Add review'. 

### Routing
We used (5) Routes for the following files below:

-Index.html

-About.jsx

-Recipes.jsx

-Recipe.jsx

-RecipeDetails.jsx

#### Bonus Items
Stretch Goals:

-Reviews or comments or ratings are options for any user to do  for any recipe resource that persists in JSON server, making our app more interactive.

-Most, if not all our images, are stored and uploaded in a Cloudinary account, owned by one of our squad members: Marlon. 

-Sorting and searching for data, filtering it down to maybe a few handful of recipes, based on an ingredient(s) to be excluded.

-Specific filter buttons -- `Vegan`, `Vegetarian` and `Gluten-Free` really cater to our user-base of very picky eaters.

# 10 USER STORIES

-The app should be free to download and available on both Apple App, Google Play stores.

-The app should include filters to cater for user customization for recipes 'without' certain ingredients.

-As a first-time user, navigation and smooth functionality to minimize frustration is key.

-As a user suffering from allergies, the app must make sense to show me my options.

-As a repeat user, any new discovery should lead to continued revisits.

-As an avid user, there should be opportunities through the app to build a community.

-As a user, trust is extremely important so the products must deliver and mean as it says.

-As a user, I want to discover easy-to-follow recipes.

-As a user, I want to be able to also search for recipes based on specific ingredients.

-As a user, there must be a diverse range of recipes. Variety is the spice of life!

## TWO (2) User Personas:

(1) Here's **Alex**, he's a dessert fiend, but absolutely can't have any recipe that includes sugar, which for sweetness, could be replaced with the following: agave, honey, or coconut shavings/flakes. He's on the right site for his sweet-tooth cravings, with our recipEATS app!

(2) Very different to Alex, is **Jennifer**. She's OK with a lil' brown, or even white sugar in her life, but she's absolutely allergic to gluten. So the term 'gluten-free' is her friend, where it helps her avoid ingredients which include flour, wheat (& its derivatives), rye, barley, malt, and more.

## Heaven Seven Group Dynamic
*Marlon Regis* - marlonregis@pursuit.org
Coming into this already-established team, I wasted no time in trying to gel together with my new squad, of whom Lenny is also a 'transfer' and new team-member. Walked squad member Haiyah in our `wireframe.cc` designed wireframes; contributed data for our manual API using my creativity and ChatGPT, with entries for our `Recipes` and `Reviews` data-points into our object structure; manned this `Readme.md` file as well as our `slides` presentation using the  "Tome" platform, from start to finish; navigated together w/Tim, the code for functionality in the `Recipes` component file; provided daily organizational updates in `Trello Board`; and set-up zoom on weekend for squad-time (w/Dan) for any blockers, which we had re `Carousel` component functionality.

*Lenny Lopez* - lennylopez@pursuit.org
A role of wearing many hats, Lenny really stepped up in his role and approach to style our `Landing page`, working together with Haiyah and Tim. Lenny also worked with Haiyah on the `Recipe` component. His input and ideas to shift and move the `About Us` link around from its original position on the Landing page, away from being too noticeable near the header, was crucial. 

*Haiyah Perez* - haiyahperez@pursuit.org
Haiyah, one of the original 'Heaven Seven' members, worked by starting off in the `About Us` page and `Landing page`, as well as built the majority of code for functionality in the `Recipe`component. She also spent a few days figuring out the functionality using outside libraries pertaining to the `carasoul component` -- one of her many ideas, to make us all look good. A great first impression anytime a user stumbles upon our Landing Page? ✅!

*Timothy Natal* - timothynatal@pursuit.org
Last, but certainly not least, Tim's role was an integral one for the squad, as the recipEATS! app is his brainchild. He tested and built the code in most components, including the `Recipes` component that myself and Tim worked on together. Again, there isn't much Tim didn't do. He's the part human, part AI filter function, working on CSS files across the board, deployed frontend and backend links, and also tirelessly worked in the `App.jsx` file. He built and created the `ReviewsForm`, `ReviewsEditForm` and `RecipeDetails` components, chipping away at any ideas that may fit into our 'stretch goals' category.

As a group, Haiyah and Tim were already the original personnel of 'Heaven Seven', whilst Lenny and myself, Marlon, were the recent 'infiltrators' haa! Overall, we got along, and we were pretty much engaged with each other daily, tackling the tasks at hand. A warning: don't ever work on a recipes/food app, without having a proper meal on your stomach! Anyway, the idea for the app was Tim's.
